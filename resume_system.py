            Year/Rank/Location: {current_example.get('year_rank_location', '')}
            Situation: {current_example.get('situation', '')}
            Task: {current_example.get('task', '')}

            LC4Q Competencies: {position_requirements.get('lc4q_competencies', '')}
            
            INSTRUCTIONS:
            1. Apply the user's specific feedback to improve the example
            2. Use exact language from key accountabilities and LC4Q competencies where possible
            3. Maintain Australian spelling and grammar
            4. Keep the STAR structure clear and concise
            5. Ensure the example remains authentic to the original situation
            
            Provide the improved example in the same JSON format.
